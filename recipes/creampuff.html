    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cream puff is a light and airy pastry ball, typically made from choux pastry, that is hollowed out and filled with whipped cream, custard, or other sweet fillings</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Instant Pudding Mix</li>
        <li>Cream and Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the instant pudding mix, heavy cream, and milk in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until the filling is set.</li>

        <li>Bring butter and water to a boil, then add the flour and salt. Stir until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the ball to a mixing bowl, then beat in eggs one at a time. Drop spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake in a preheated oven until they're golden brown on the outside and dry on the inside.</li>

        <li>Let the choux pastry cool. Fill the cream puffs in one of two ways: Split the pastries and fill or pipe the pudding mixture into the shells.</li>
